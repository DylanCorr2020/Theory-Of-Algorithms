    "In computer science, there exist some problems whose solutions are not yet found, the problems are divided into classes known as Complexity Classes. A complexity class is a set of computational problems which can be computed within a given a rescource or in a paticular setting. These classes help scientists to groups problems based on how much time and space they require to solve problems and verify the solutions.\n",
